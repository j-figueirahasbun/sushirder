# Sushirder

Small HTML/CSS/Javascript Project with the focus of practicing purely HTML and CSS, with just a bit of Javascript 

This project contains notes as comments. While this is not the ideal clean way of coding, it reflects the learning process that occured throughout the project.

To run the project clone the repository and then run the following: 

npm run dev 

the server will run on localhost:5173
